The project focuses on the development and implementation of a univariate time series forecasting model leveraging machine learning methodologies to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The dataset used for this analysis comprises stock market data for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), specifically detailing the daily closing prices over a defined period. The primary objective of the model is to generate accurate predictions of future stock prices by identifying underlying patterns and trends in the historical closing price data.

To construct the model, various machine learning techniques were applied, including feature engineering, model selection, and parameter tuning. The univariate nature of the model restricts the input to the closing prices of TSLA, without incorporating external factors such as market sentiment, news, or macroeconomic indicators. The model was trained and validated using a portion of the dataset, with the remaining data reserved for testing and evaluation.

The accuracy of the final model is approximately 60%, which is considered relatively low for a stock price prediction task. However, this outcome serves to reinforce the Random Walk Theory, which posits that stock prices follow a random and unpredictable path, making them inherently difficult to forecast with high precision. The results of the model suggest that, despite the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques, stock prices exhibit significant volatility and randomness, thereby supporting the notion that stock price movements cannot be consistently predicted over time.
